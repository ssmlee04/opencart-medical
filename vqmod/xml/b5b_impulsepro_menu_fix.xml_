		INSTRUCTIONS

		INTRO
		Since there are thousands of OpenCart extensions available and everyone uses different combinations of extensions,
		it is impossible to create just one file that will work for everyone. So you will have to edit this file based
		on the extensions you have. Please share your version of this file with me, so that I can compile it together for future release.
		support @ base5builder.com
		I will place you username in the credits if you wish.
		

		HOW TO
		1. Go to your vQmod file path: [root]/vqmod/xml
		2. Find the xml files for extensions that you use. Open the file.
		3. In the open xml file, find "<file name="view/template/common/header.tpl">"
		4. Depending on how the developer wrote the code, the "<operation>" tag should have something similar to the one below. The example below is for the Export/Import extension. 

			<operation>
				<search position="after"><![CDATA[<li><a href="<?php echo $backup; ?>"><?php echo $text_backup; ?></a></li>]]></search>
				<add><![CDATA[        <li><a href="<?php echo $export; ?>"><?php echo $text_export; ?></a></li>]]></add>
			</operation>

		5. Copy the entire "<operation>" tag and content
		6. Open "impulsepro_menu_fix.xml" (this file) and paste it within the "<file>" tag.
			(Scroll down and see the place that says "Paste Below This Line")
		7. You have to do this for all your extensions. It doesn't take long.
